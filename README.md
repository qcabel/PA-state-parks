# Pennsylvania state parks exploration with FourSquare Place API 

The state of Pennsylvania has a total of 121 state parks, as of 2016. 

The short project here intended to first cluster in an unsupervised way, then to fit for parks' popularity to identify main factors impacting park quality (which may be used for recommendation as well as recognizing potential issues may be improved for the park).
Things learnt from the PA parks may be generalized to other states and the framework can be expanded by incorporating information from other place APIs.
